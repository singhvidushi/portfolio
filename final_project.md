# Final Project: Content Wars: How Streaming Giants Tailor Genres to Captivate Their Audiences
## Part I
  
## Outline
### Context and Background: 
Streaming platforms have changed the way we consume content. With an overwhelming number of options from platforms like Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, Hulu, and Netflix, the challenge for binge-watchers isn’t just what to watch, but where to watch it. This project analyzes how each platform curates its content by genre, helping viewers make informed decisions about which platform best aligns with their favorite genres.

### Why This Topic? 
**Personal Motivation:** I’ve always been fascinated by the power of stories and how they can shape our perspectives. As an avid viewer, I often wonder why I’m drawn to certain shows and movies on different platforms. Why do I find myself binge-watching dramas on Netflix but switch to documentaries on Amazon Prime? This project is my way of answering those questions. It’s personal because I’m trying to understand my own viewing habits and the subtle ways these platforms influence what I choose to watch.

**Professional Relevance:** In my professional journey, I’ve been involved in roles that mix technology, data, and design. This project lets me bring all these interests together. By analyzing how platforms use data to shape their content strategies, I’m not just satisfying my curiosity—I’m also building skills that are relevant for a career in tech or media. It’s a way for me to connect the dots between my love for storytelling and my interest in data-driven decision-making.

### Reader's Perspective:

## Sketches
### Sketch 1: Overall Genre Trend Across Platforms (Stacked Area Chart)
<img src="OverallGenreTrend.png" alt="Sketch 1" width="700" />

#### Purpose: 
This sketch serves as the foundation for understanding the evolution of genres over time across all streaming platforms. It visualizes the distribution of major genres, such as Drama, Comedy, Action, Documentary, Kids, Sci-Fi, and Romance, from 1920 to 2021.
The sketch shows a multi-layered area chart with the x-axis representing the years (1920-2021) and the y-axis representing the number of titles released per genre each year. Each layer is color-coded to represent a different genre, with annotations for key turning points in genre popularity, such as the emergence of the Sci-Fi genre in the 1950s or the surge in documentaries in the 2010s. This sketch is the starting point for understanding the broader trends before delving into platform-specific strategies.

#### Why I’ve Chosen This Visualization:
- **Historical Perspective:** The stacked area chart provides a clear visual representation of how genre popularity has shifted over the decades, offering a broad historical context. It helps identify periods of significant change, such as the rise of specific genres or the decline of others.
- **Visual Impact:** The flowing design of the stacked area chart captures the fluid nature of genre evolution, making it easier for the viewer to see how genres have waxed and waned in popularity over time.
- **Insightful Trends:** By showing the overall trends for all platforms combined, this visualization sets the stage for a deeper exploration into individual platform strategies. It provides a comprehensive view of the streaming landscape, showing how collective audience preferences have changed.

### Sketch 2: Genre Popularity by Platform (Grouped Bar Chart)
<img src="GenrePopularity.png" alt="Sketch 2" width="700" />

#### Purpose: 
This sketch breaks down the genre distribution by each streaming platform (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus) for key genres, showing how each platform focuses on different types of content to differentiate themselves in a competitive market.
The sketch features a horizontal bar chart with genres listed along the y-axis and the number of titles on the x-axis. Each genre has four bars representing the platforms, color-coded to differentiate between Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Disney Plus. Annotations are included to highlight key observations, such as Hulu's strong emphasis on documentaries or Netflix's expansive drama library. This visualization allows the viewer to quickly grasp the content focus of each platform and how they compete in various genres.
#### Why I’ve Chosen This Visualization:
- **Platform Comparison:** The grouped bar chart allows for direct comparison between platforms, highlighting how each service invests in different genres. It makes it easy to see, for instance, that Netflix might prioritize Drama while Disney Plus leans heavily into Family/Kids content.
- **Content Strategy Insight:** By visualizing genre distribution side-by-side, this chart provides a snapshot of each platform’s content strategy, revealing which genres are most significant for each service.
- **Audience Targeting:** This visualization also hints at the target demographics of each platform, as different genres appeal to different audiences. It helps the viewer understand why certain platforms might be more attractive to specific audience segments.

### Sketch 3: Emerging and Declining Genre Trends (Multi-Line Graph)
<img src="EmergingDecliningTrends.png" alt="Sketch 3" width="700" />

#### Purpose: 
This sketch focuses on the changing trajectories of specific genres across all platforms, illustrating how some genres have gained popularity while others have declined over the past decades.
The sketch depicts multiple lines representing different genres like Drama, Comedy, Sci-Fi, Documentary, Action, and Kids, plotted against the x-axis of years (1950-2030). Each line shows the number of titles released over time, with distinct peaks and troughs marking significant shifts. Annotations indicate key events that may have influenced these trends, such as Netflix’s investment in original Sci-Fi series or Disney Plus’s emphasis on family content. This visualization helps the viewer see not just the current state but the potential trajectory of genre trends across platforms.

#### Why I’ve Chosen This Visualization:
- **Dynamic Insights:** The multi-line graph highlights the dynamic nature of genre popularity, showcasing genres that are currently trending upward or experiencing a decline. It provides a more nuanced view of the data, emphasizing the evolving tastes of audiences and the adaptive strategies of platforms.
- **Predictive Analysis:** This visualization can also serve as a predictive tool, suggesting which genres might continue to grow or fall in the coming years. It's particularly useful for understanding the current state of the streaming market and potential future directions.
- **Cross-Platform View:** Unlike the stacked area chart, which focuses on total trends, this line graph breaks down the genre changes more granularly, allowing for cross-platform comparisons and a deeper dive into emerging genres.

## Method & Medium

For this project, I will employ a combination of tools and platforms to perform data analysis, create visualizations, and present the findings in a clear and engaging manner. The approach is divided into three main stages: data preparation, visualization, and presentation.

### 1. Data Preparation
**Tools Used:** Excel and Python  
**Process:**
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** The raw data sourced from Kaggle will be cleaned and prepared using Excel and Python. This includes handling missing values, standardizing genre names, filtering irrelevant data, and merging datasets where necessary.
- **Data Analysis:** Using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, I will conduct preliminary analyses to understand the structure and characteristics of the data. This step will help identify key insights and trends that will be explored in the visualizations.

### 2. Data Visualization
**Tool Used:** Tableau  
**Process:**
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Tableau will be used to create interactive and dynamic visualizations that allow users to explore the data. This includes stacked area charts, grouped bar charts, and multi-line graphs that showcase the evolution of genres, platform-specific strategies, and emerging trends.
- **Customization and Interactivity:** The visualizations will be customized with filters for genres, platforms, and years, enabling users to delve deeper into specific aspects of the data. Annotations and tooltips will be added to highlight key insights and provide additional context.

### 3. Presentation
**Tool Used:** Shorthand  
**Process:**
- **Narrative Structure:** The visualizations and findings will be embedded in a Shorthand presentation to create a cohesive and engaging narrative. This platform allows for a seamless integration of text, images, and interactive charts, making the content accessible and visually appealing.
- **Storytelling:** The presentation will guide the audience through the evolution of streaming platforms, their genre strategies, and how these have shaped audience preferences over time. Key sections will include context and background, major insights from the visualizations, and actionable conclusions.
