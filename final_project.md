## Outline
### Introduction: 
The battle for audience attention among streaming giants—Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, Hulu, and Netflix—has intensified over the years. Each platform has strategically curated its content library to appeal to distinct viewer segments, leveraging genre preferences to maximize engagement. This project aims to explore the evolution of content genres across these platforms from 1920 to 2021, analyzing how genre choices align with each platform's target demographics. By examining these trends, we can uncover the strategic decisions driving content curation and the shifting tastes of streaming audiences.

### Objective: 
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the evolution of genres across Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, Hulu, and Netflix, and to understand how each platform tailors its content to resonate with its audience. This study will highlight the popularity shifts in different genres, the alignment of content with target demographics, and emerging trends that are shaping the streaming landscape.

### Key Questions:
- How have genre preferences evolved over time on each platform?
- What are the primary target demographics for each platform, and how do genre trends align with them?
- Which genres have seen the most significant growth or decline, and how does this correlate with platform strategies?
- What emerging genres are gaining traction, and which platforms are leading in catering to these new audience segments?
