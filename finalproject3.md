## Part III

### Feedback from Designers
In the final portion of my presentation, I talked to people outside my personas as well to gauge whether my dashboard was useful and whether they were able to understand what to do and interact with it properly.

### Changes After Part II
- I added **Movie/TV Show Recommendations**, which will show 3 titles based on the selections the user makes.
- I made a **dark mode** for the dashboard as people suggested that they binge-watch mostly at night, and white backgrounds were straining for their eyes. I added a button at the top-right corner to switch between modes.
- I made the header more descriptive, which brings out more clarity. Here is the change:
  
  **Before:**
  _Stream Smart: Discover the Best Platforms for Your Favorite Genres!_
  
  **Curious about where to stream your favorite genres? This dashboard breaks down the top streaming platforms â€” Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+ , showing you the number of titles available, the percentage share each platform holds for specific genres, and trends over time. Use the filters to explore which platform dominates in your favorite category and make your next binge-watch decision easier!_
  
  **After:**
  _Stream Smart: Discover the Best Platforms for Your Favorite Genres!_

  **Explore how top streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+ stack up in offering your favorite content genres. Dive into the data to see platform preferences, track content trends over time, and get recommendations based on your selection. Make smarter streaming decisions with insights tailored to your viewing tastes!_

### What I Learned:
- **Tools:**
  - **Shorthand:** A great tool to present stories in a more creative way.
  - **Flourish:** To make my graphs interactive.
  - **Tableau Dashboard:** A tool to display data in an interactive way so people can engage with it.

- I also learned about people's viewing habits. It was astonishing to know we spend 3 hours watching TV a day, and half an hour deciding what to watch. So it became clear that there is something we can do to help make choosing easier.
- I also learned that many platforms have a secondary genre they want to focus on:
  - **Disney+**: Family content
  - **Netflix**: International content
  - **Amazon**: Drama
  - **Hulu**: Drama and reality TV
