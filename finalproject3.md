# Final Project: Content Wars: How Streaming Giants Tailor Genres to Captivate Their Audiences
---
## Part III: Final Deliverable and Presentation
---

### Feedback from Designers

In the final portion of my project, I gathered feedback from people outside of my original personas to see if the dashboard was intuitive and easy to use. The goal was to ensure that users could understand the insights and interact with the dashboard effectively. 

### Changes After Part II

Based on feedback from designers and users, I implemented the following changes:

- **Movie/TV Show Recommendations**: I added a feature that recommends 3 specific titles based on the genre the user selects. This makes the dashboard more interactive and provides personalized suggestions, helping users make quicker decisions.
  
- **Dark Mode**: Since many users binge-watch content at night, they suggested that white backgrounds were too straining for their eyes. In response, I added a **dark mode** to the dashboard, with a button at the top-right corner to toggle between day and night modes.

- **Descriptive Header**: I revised the header to provide more clarity and context. The original text was adjusted to better communicate the purpose of the dashboard:

  **Before:**
  _Stream Smart: Discover the Best Platforms for Your Favorite Genres!_
  
  *Curious about where to stream your favorite genres? This dashboard breaks down the top streaming platforms — Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+ , showing you the number of titles available, the percentage share each platform holds for specific genres, and trends over time. Use the filters to explore which platform dominates in your favorite category and make your next binge-watch decision easier!*

  **After:**
  _Stream Smart: Discover the Best Platforms for Your Favorite Genres!_

  *Explore how top streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+ stack up in offering your favorite content genres. Dive into the data to see platform preferences, track content trends over time, and get recommendations based on your selection. Make smarter streaming decisions with insights tailored to your viewing tastes!*

### What I Learned

This project gave me the opportunity to explore various tools and learn more about user behavior. Here are the key takeaways:

- **Tools Used**:
  - **Shorthand**: A great tool for presenting stories creatively. I used Shorthand to build an engaging and interactive narrative around the data.
  - **Flourish**: Helped me create interactive graphs that made the data more digestible for users.
  - **Tableau Dashboard**: This was instrumental in making the data interactive, allowing users to explore genre trends and platform preferences.

- **User Insights**: I learned that people spend, on average, 3 hours watching TV a day, with about half an hour spent deciding what to watch. This insight reinforced the need for a tool that helps streamline decision-making.
  
- **Platform Preferences**: I also discovered that many streaming platforms have a perticular genre they focus on:
  - **Disney+**: Primarily focuses on family content.
  - **Netflix**: International content is a significant focus area.
  - **Amazon Prime**: Drama dominates the content library.
  - **Hulu**: Has a strong focus on drama and reality TV.

By integrating these findings, I was able to refine the dashboard to cater to users' content preferences more effectively, and ensure that the visualizations and features helped users make smarter decisions about their viewing habits.

### Reflection and Final Thoughts

Completing this project has been an enriching experience that blended my interests in storytelling, data analysis, and user experience design. By analyzing how streaming platforms curate their content by genre, I not only deepened my understanding of content strategies but also honed my skills in data visualization and interactive dashboard design.

The feedback from UX designers was instrumental in refining the visual and interactive aspects of my project, ensuring that the final deliverables are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally effective. This iterative process underscored the importance of user-centered design and the value of incorporating diverse perspectives to enhance the overall quality of the work.

Moving forward, I aim to apply these insights to future projects, continuing to prioritize user experience and data-driven storytelling to create impactful and engaging content.
