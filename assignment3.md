Souce: Google Trends

#### Why:
I chose the "Generative AI Search Trends in the United States" visualization from Google Trends because it highlights the growing interest in popular AI image generation tools across different U.S. regions. This topic is timely and relevant as AI tools continue to transform creative industries.
- MidJourney,
- Stable Diffusion, and
- DALL-E

The visualization's use of a geographic map and bar chart allows for quick comparisons, but there are opportunities for improvement in displaying detailed comparisons, enhancing interactivity, and addressing accessibility. These factors make it a compelling choice for a thoughtful critique and redesign.

## Step 2: Critique the data visualization
| **Heuristic**     | **What I Like**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **What I Dislike**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **What I Wish I Saw**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Usefulness**    | The area map cleanly represents state-by-state interest in AI image generation tools. The bar graph is easy to read, and the distinct colors make differentiating between tools straightforward. **Why it matters**: This matches the **usefulness** heuristic by providing a clear overview of how each state’s interest is distributed. | The map gives the impression that only one tool is in use per state (e.g., North Dakota and West Virginia are highlighted in yellow). This hides the fact that all three tools are being used in those states, which reduces insight. **Why it matters**: This breaks the **truthfulness** heuristic by oversimplifying the data, misleading the user about tool dominance.                                  | A stacked bar graph directly on the map or an overlapping representation of tool usage in each state. **Why it matters**: This would improve **completeness** and **truthfulness** by giving a more nuanced and accurate depiction of tool usage, making the data more actionable and detailed.                                                                                                                |
| **Completeness**  | The visualization gives a clear overview of which tools are preferred in different states, based on search interest. **Why it matters**: This meets the **completeness** heuristic by providing relevant and understandable information, offering a useful high-level breakdown.                                            | The x-axis of the bar graph doesn’t display percentages unless you hover over the bars, making it difficult to compare states at a glance. Additionally, the map doesn’t provide a detailed breakdown for each tool in a state, which could confuse users. **Why it matters**: This violates the **perceptibility** and **completeness** heuristics, making it harder to interpret full details.            | Percentages labeled directly on the bars and tooltips on the map that show all three tools' percentages for each state, not just the majority one. **Why it matters**: This would improve **completeness** by showing all relevant data and improve **perceptibility** by making it easier to compare without needing to hover, allowing users to access more data with less effort.                        |
| **Perceptibility** | The clean and simple design of the area map and bar graph makes it easy to follow visually. **Why it matters**: This satisfies the **perceptibility** heuristic by presenting data in a clear and easy-to-read format, enabling users to absorb the information quickly.                                                 | The pop-up tooltip that appears when you hover over a state blocks the state name, making it difficult to identify the state. Additionally, the blue and yellow color scheme implies that only one tool dominates each state, even though multiple tools are in use. **Why it matters**: This goes against **perceptibility** and **truthfulness**, as it misleads users about full usage within the state.  | A tooltip that doesn’t block the state name and a color gradient (or pie chart overlay) to show how each tool is used in every state. **Why it matters**: This would improve **perceptibility** by making the data easier to access and interpret, and would also enhance **truthfulness** by representing proportional tool usage more accurately.                          |
| **Truthfulness**   | The data seems accurate in highlighting the most popular tool in each state. **Why it matters**: This aligns with the **truthfulness** heuristic, as the data is presented reliably and reflects actual search interest.                                                                                             | The map implies that only one tool is in significant use in each state, which isn’t true. Additionally, not displaying percentages on the x-axis of the bar graph could lead users to misinterpret the data. **Why it matters**: This misrepresentation violates **truthfulness**, as users don’t get the full picture of the actual usage distribution.                                    | More nuanced visual cues (e.g., stacked bars or proportional circles) to show that multiple tools are being used in each state. Also, percentages visible on the bar chart without needing to hover. **Why it matters**: This would enhance **truthfulness** by offering a more complete picture of tool usage, and **perceptibility** by making the data easier to compare at a glance.                     |
| **Intuitiveness**  | The overall layout is intuitive, with clear labels and distinct colors for each tool. **Why it matters**: This meets the **intuitiveness** heuristic because the map and bar chart are familiar formats that make it easy for users to navigate and understand.                                                        | The bar graph always places MidJourney at the top, even when other tools are selected for comparison. This makes it harder to compare the data for other tools. **Why it matters**: This breaks the **intuitiveness** heuristic, adding unnecessary cognitive load by not adapting the graph to user selections, making comparisons more difficult.                  | Dynamically sorted bar charts based on the tool selected, and more accessible details when hovering over the bar graph. **Why it matters**: This would improve **intuitiveness** and **usefulness**, allowing users to quickly and easily compare tool interest without unnecessary effort or confusion.                                                                  |
| **Aesthetics**     | The visual simplicity of both the map and the bar graph is aesthetically pleasing, and the colors are distinct enough to differentiate between the tools. **Why it matters**: This satisfies the **aesthetic** heuristic by ensuring that the visuals are clean and not distracting from the data itself.                    | The yellow and blue states feel too binary, lacking nuance, and the overall visuals could be more engaging. Additionally, the color scheme might be problematic for users with visual impairments (e.g., color blindness). **Why it matters**: This breaks the **aesthetic** and **perceptibility** heuristics, as it may not engage users fully or offer accessible visuals. | Nuanced color gradients to reflect tool dominance and subtle textures or icons to increase engagement. **Why it matters**: This would enhance **aesthetics** and **engagement**, making the visualization more visually interesting and accessible, while maintaining clarity and readability for all users, including those with visual impairments.                       |
| **Engagement**     | The area map and bar graph are engaging, providing users with multiple ways to explore the data. **Why it matters**: This meets the **engagement** heuristic by inviting users to interact with the visualization, encouraging them to explore different states and tools.                                               | The map’s tooltip blocks state names, and percentages in the bar graph are only visible on hover. This makes it harder for users to quickly engage with the data. **Why it matters**: This breaks **engagement** and **perceptibility** heuristics, as users have to work harder to access key information, discouraging deeper exploration.                        | A more interactive experience with filters on the map, tooltips that don’t block state names, and visible percentages on the bar graph. **Why it matters**: This would improve **engagement** by allowing users to explore the data more seamlessly, and enhance **perceptibility** by making key data points immediately available without extra effort.                    |
